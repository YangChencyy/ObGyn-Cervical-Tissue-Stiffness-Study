Authors: Yang Chen, Mingyi Tang, Simeone Marino <br/>
Mentor: Prof. Ivo Dinov



I worked with collaborators from Michigan Medicine on predicting mothersâ€™ term and preterm births with new clinical features.
<br/><br/>
This UM pregnancy study analyzes cervical tissue stiffness using a new quantitative technique, based on ultrasound imaging measures, called Fully Quantitative Cervical Elastography System. I being one leader from the SOCR team works with them on the data analytics and machine learning prediction for this project.

The generated results file as well as the datasets will be uploaded once we finish the paper and publish it.
